Every day there will be new coming emails regarding recent events. Players will make decisions on events, which will either positively or negatively impacting the school as reflected in the 4 primary stats.


The **email interface** will be implemented through console input and output. Every day there will be a new-coming event determined by a randomized function that extracts a random event from the **event database**. Every event is behaved as a tree with possible mutiple future events as branches. For each event, player will be given multiple options to decide from.

The **decision making function** will be implemented additively to reflect impacts on the 4 primary stats player made through the decision. It is also responsible for checking if the game has come an end.

There will be an **event database** which is an Relational database seperate from the c++ code. The main program will be able to at random get events from the event table
